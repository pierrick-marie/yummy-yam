<h2 class="h4" style="padding-top: 2em;">The following informations will help you to understand how it works</h2>

<p class="paragraph">
	I built this theme to have a highly customizable single web page.
	That page already includes JQuery, Bootstrap and Fontawesome.
	It generates a dynamic main menu.
	All the content is split in different html files.
	It is possible to add your own CSS and Javascript files. <br>
	
	To summary, Yummy Yam is just a skeleton to create a new HTML web page.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
	In Yummy Yam a section is a file stored in *content* folder.

	All sections are sorted following their weight. <br>
	This section have been place in first position because its weight is 1. <br>
	All sections with weight 0 are not included.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
	If a section has a title in heading, it is automatically included as a title in the HTML body.
